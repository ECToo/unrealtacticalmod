//===============================================
Created By: Darknet

Information: The coding will be format differently
to deal with Mecha code format or some format for
unreal. The Controls and Weapon system are not yet
build. The weapon system will be build little
differently from unreal. This deal with weapon fire
functions when the weapon over heat or used too much
power. That will create a cool down until it is use
again.

Features:
 * Custom Mecha Parts
 * Menu Mecha (This deal with select parts to be spawn in game)
 * Mecha Humanoid (Stand Alone Mesh Frame)
 * Mecha Spider
 * Mecha Crawler
 * Mecha Hover

MechaPart = prefix for changing parts for the mech.
VehicleMecha = is a vehicle and placeable class.
Content = prefix those are prefab build for the mecha.

Note: Some of the packages will be class name.
Example class'MechaPart' not class'Mecha.MechaPart'.
Since it will be freely deal with codes changes.
This package deal with Mech build test. I don't
like tons of code that is not mech build. Packages
will be build differently and building some part
of the codes from scrape to reduce extra codes.

NOTE: THIS IS NOT FINAL BUILD. IT ALPHA BUILD.
