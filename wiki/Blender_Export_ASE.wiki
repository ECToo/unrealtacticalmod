#summary Static Mesh Format. Collsion Build.
#labels Blender,Export,ASE

=Information:=
When your exporting to unreal. Make sure you Duplicate your object that is simple collsion.  Make that object same as your current object with the prefix "UCX_" before the object name. Example default name object is "cube" for the first object and the second name is "UCX_cube". If there is too much compelex build a simple collision else it will tell you that there is a problems. The collision have to be simple.

This from OutLiner Panel:

Scene
 * RenderLayer
 * World
 * Camera
 * Lamp
 * Cube
 * UCX_Cube

Trouble shooting:
If you canâ€™t get your collision working try to scale your mesh to one to one unit. If you create a small that it seem it does not detect your collision very well when the object little.

=Pros=
1:1 Ratio to blender to unreal scale. For Vehicle varery in "rawscale=1.3".
 
=Cons=
-There not collisiont that I have not found yet.
