#summary This talk about AnimNodeSequence for Animation.

= Information: =

  This section deal with more control with your animations. You can control speed of the animation or where to start your animation. But the default animation speed is 1.0 float rate. Note you need to config your own speed since there different on how fast your animation set is. The AnimNodeSequence node needed to be setup the link to the packages  and unreal script to able play the animations. Some part was explain in [SkeletalMesh_AnimaitonB].



  When creating the AnimTree for your animation set up to work. You need to add AnimNodeSequence into your kismet area and link the node to the Animation.

Then we name the AnimNode to match your code in unreal script.

	Super.PostBeginPlay();
	AnimPlayControl = AnimNodeSequence(Mesh.Animations.FindAnimNode('AnimPlayer'));//AnimTree
}
