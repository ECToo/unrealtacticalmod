= Information: =
   There are two files that make a simple AI code. But it very hard to do. I don't have all the information yet still looking into and currently building the AI for pawn bot. But it depend how you want to build the AI. Building or custom AI build is not an easy task to do. It deal with many function that make up an bot. Example looking, fire a weapon, looking for a path, attack pattern, and etc.

= Pawn: =
   There is Pawn class is where able to enter the world of unreal. When the game started and player spawn as pawn. There you find ControllerClass in the defaultproperties but depend if has it or not. ControllerClass support the AI function where it think and what to do next.

= AIController: =
   This class support AI and thinking functions. But it need pawn class to able to use it. The AI need to have something to interact in the real world with a physical body or object. To able to do something when the AI is thinking and doing some work in the game world.

= Tips: =
 * MiningRobot (easy)
 * WeldingRobot (easy)
 * UTBot (hard)
Those are the most simple code. Look and read the code.
