   I current working on the pages to be update much as possible. I try to get most in HUD design while work on other projects.

  From what I gather. The file have to have xml format correct to load into UDK scaleform HUD. Like image and font file.

= Area in research: =
 * HUD
 * Actionscript2 (work in progress)
 * Actionscript3 (not yet seen the release yet)
 * Getting the variable from swf to unreal script and kismet.


== Pros: ==
 * Able to load image file.
 * Still looking for good ones.

== Cons: ==
 * used actionscript 2
 * File path for font may not work all the time.
  * Error in the console for font missing file.
  * Working on the path issued
 * You can not fully used scaleform since there are graphic user interface editor. Mean you have to create your own buttons, menus, etc.
 * You can't really use the classes in some area a limited.
 * You have to create a render and clear graphic.

=== Notes: ===
 * Takes a while to find right coding and many other things.
 * Hate writing things down in the cons section. Waiting for actionscript3 if supported.
