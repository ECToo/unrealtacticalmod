#summary Main Actionscript2 Section. Information content table .

= Information: =
   I current working on the pages to be update much as possible. I try to get most in HUD design while work on other projects.

  From what I gather. The file have to have xml format correct to load into UDK scaleform HUD. Like image and font file. It deal with file convert to symbol that is the library added into the swf. Mean it the flash program the editor is similar to FlashDevelop library add to file.

= Content: =
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_HUD Actionscript 2 to UDK HUD]
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_TextField Basic Text Field]
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_FontLoading Basic Font Loading] 
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_ImageLoading Image Loading]
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_Variable_Access Variable Access]
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_External External Call]
 * [UDK_FlashDevelop_AS2_ArrayString Array String]


= Area in research: =
 * HUD
 * Actionscript2 (work in progress)
 * Actionscript3 (not yet seen the release yet)
 * Getting the variable from swf to unreal script and kismet.


== Pros: ==
 * Able to load image file.
 * Still looking for good ones.
 * Able to set and get array string from flash and unreal script.

== Cons: ==
 * used actionscript 2
 * Font error that deal with embed file.
 * You can not fully used scaleform since there are graphic user interface editor. Mean you have to create your own buttons, menus, etc.
 * You can't really use the classes in some area a limited.
 * You have to create a render and clear graphic.

=== Notes: ===
 * Takes a while to find right coding and many other things.
 * Hate writing things down in the cons section. Waiting for actionscript3 if supported.
