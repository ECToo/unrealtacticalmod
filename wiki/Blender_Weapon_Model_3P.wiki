This is for third person where you see a player holding a weapon that you will be position your weapon with two bones for holding your weapon on your right hand and the other is your left hand that is hold weapon under it.


= Blender Root Bone: =
Since We have two bones all we need what are their names? Basic the bone name for the root is "b_gun_root" that for your holding your weapon and your second bone will be "b_gun_lefthand" that depend if you want to hold on to the weapon or not holding it. Sound simple and easy.
