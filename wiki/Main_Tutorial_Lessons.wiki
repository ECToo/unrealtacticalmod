It will be hard to tell you if you don't read or do lesson about Blender. Please do not rush when your learning blender. It is base on blender term language for blender interface. This section will give you the basic information about making game mod still working some area for a bit to update this section of the wiki page. Each part of this section is where I am currently working on. Some of the information can be missing working hard to debug my script to be free of error. Updating the wiki page will take time to complete.

There are example files in the svn that you can use to test out your current blender files if your files are working right.

= Blender Bone Format For Unreal =
To make unreal bones work in blender you need to look in the svn files that follow the format. Just use unreal format bones to make it clean and free of bugs. To get unreal format do not connect the bones. Parent them by linking the bone to the parent name.

It depend what type bone builds to export to unreal. It is your chose to create your own bones or use unreal format bone. Test out a simple animation to make sure the animation is working correctly. Create one Armature bone for the unreal to work.
