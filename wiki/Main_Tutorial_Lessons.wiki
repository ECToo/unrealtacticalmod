= Introduction =
This section will give you the basic information about making game mod still working some area for a bit to update this section of the wiki page. There are example files in the svn that you can use to test out your current blender files if your files are working right. Each part of this section is where I am currently working on. Some of the information can be missing working hard to debug my script to be free of error. Updating the wiki page take time to complete.

== Blender Armature ==
Blender takes time to translate the head and the tail to work together in their position , rotation, and transform for animation and skeleton. This script is an on from people who work on it. So I am taking my time to learn what part need to work one at the time.

==To Test out the bone position it in the svn:==

http://code.google.com/p/unrealtacticalmod/source/browse/trunk/Blender/3cube.blend
This will test out thet bone position and rotation still work when the version needs to be update. I know there some error that I don't see. When I am testing it out. Long testing and crashes to get the export working.

== Downloads ==
There are download section for Blender Plug-in for current version that has not yet release or have no time to update them.

==Export Script for blender Information:==
[Blender_Export_PS_A_K_Version]

== Videos And Demos ==
Here a demo of my vehicle amd weapon just it testing for fun. Relation to svn blender file.

== Weapon Build  ==
This weapon will be base of Shockrifle. Animation Test Done workable weapon.

Error Found on my part. But the curent versin works. I didn't double check the my work the different between the animation and the mesh. That was during my test. For export scripts run tests. It may take some time how are the rotation and location work in unreal for animation debug area. Once I test out for 1P View I will release it.

== Character Build  ==
This may take even longer dealing with size and rotation. So leave as is. I am not good at rotation to the bone.

I was able to create a character but it unfinish work. This just a demo working on the new version of the export. But I not sure about the export size of the character.

http://unrealtacticalmod.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Screen_Shots/blender_character_testv9.jpg

This is another update for bone position and rotation fix. I am not sure it fully tested. I only able to test out for character bones build for rotation and position. This is version is is for 0.0.9. That is little stable for the bones.
