#summary Read This Before You Export And Get An Error.

= Check Your Work =
You have to save your work every time to fix your bone rotation because it does not update your rotation when exports it. For I test out and it was getting the same rotation when it was not update, so save your blender file to get your bone update to unreal. I don't knows why that happens. If you rotate your bone be sure it the axis does not change else it change the axis when reach at a 90 degree that it will switch the two axis. Use the Draw axis when youâ€™re in bone selected.

Check your your files that matches from the svn. IF the file matches the rotation. It will work.
