#summary Working classes for blender Export.

= Information: =
   I am running quick test for different classes. To see if blender work when exporting to unreal.

= Classes: =
== Vehicles ==
-Hellbender [Working]
   Working just need to work on the size of the wheel.

-Raptor [Working]
   It is working due to the size of the object. If you build the vehicle too small it will be hard to be detect in unreal once it convert to unreal format package.

   If the object is too small like 3 units. It will not work correctly since the blender and unreal is the same ratio. One bone test. Get you kill when you enter the vehicle. Move speed 100000000.

-Manta [Working]
   When working with manta class, be sure you name the bone correct as the root name.

   One bone test. Crashes when vehicle was summon. Bone!=Index Error.

== Weapons ==
-ShockRife [Working]
   Working Animation. Working weapon fire and alt fire.
