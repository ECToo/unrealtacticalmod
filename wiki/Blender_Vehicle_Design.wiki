There are couple thing you need to know:
    * Action Editor(Blender) To Animation set(Unreal) as AnimSet
    * Model Damages (Where are the Damages Common in the game)
    * Textures ()
      * Texture Damages ()
      * Texture Realist.
      * Normal Mapping

Well those are the basic but there more of them dealing with textures, modeling and animation.
