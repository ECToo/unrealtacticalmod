There are four method for export to unreal.

=EXPORT=
==.PSK :Skeleton Mesh==
This support your vehicle, weapon, and character bone in Skeleton Mesh. Most of the code are update a bit.

==.PSA : Animation Set(unreal)/Action Editor(Blender)==
This is where you animation work to play a simple animation like walking.

==.ASE : STATIC MESH==
This where you can create static mesh and your collision using a prefix "UCX_" with the same object name. Just copy it but it has to be simple collision.

==.DAE :==
Two is .dae file that can work good. This can only export one bone only that I found out just the version I test was 1.4.0. The vehicle works when I code it because it was the default name. There is no animation support.

==.FBX :==
This can export the animation and skeleton mesh. Export for FBX XNA for skeleton mesh. There no current animation yet.

Note Blender 2.50 version are being update a bit. Dae, fbx, psk, and psa are being update.
