#summary Simple spawning a Vehicle using UIScene.

= Information: =
   This section will deal with simple creation on spawning the vehicle using the scene menu to spawn a vehicle for you. Note this just deal with spawning a vehicle from the scene menu.

   You will be dealing with 6 files. Four files for unreal script. One for UIScene build package. One for simple static mesh build.

 * http://unrealtacticalmod.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Unpublished/CookedPC/ > BuildingSpawnVehicle.upk

= Getting started: =
   Before you can build my unreal script you need to learn few things. You will get some some errors.

   First thing you need to do is to build the UISceneBuildVehicle.uc. You will get an error in some of my class. Then you have to build the UIScene Package.

Work in progress.

= Note: =
 * When your are testing the use trigger in editor map for the menu scene. It may crash since the trigger may cause to crash when you exit the debug game to return to edit map. That I need to be fix some how.
