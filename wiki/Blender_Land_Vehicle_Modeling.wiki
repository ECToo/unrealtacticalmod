= Plan Before you model =
There are couple thing you need to know:
 * Animation set
 * Model Damages
 * Textures
 * Texture Damages
 * Texture etc.
 * Texture Damage

I think that all the basic and planing ahead is a good idea what you doing step by step. It will save time and work. Make your mesh face the direction of the unreal game. The svn has the dirction for the vehicle to face.
