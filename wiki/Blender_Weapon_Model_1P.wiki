= Check Your Work =
If your reading this section you should have save your file inlcude with your texture and name it as weaponname with the prefix "_1P". weaponname_1P. This will let you know that the file must be in the final stage. If you made a mistake and all your animation you work hard work into the first person. Then DO NOT DELETE YOUR FILE you can make a new one and append the armature that you can open another file within another file.

= Armature Bones =
Make sure you have one Armature then the next one should be a bone by default your in the main Armature to branch off the that Armature bones. Add your bones where your animation is need. Link the bones, but not to connect them. Bone are build little differently for unreal.

There are two method to adding your bones but one of the doesn't work. The method that doesn't work while your in Armature(Edit Mode) with using your (ctrl + right click mouse) that will center all your bones to zero.
