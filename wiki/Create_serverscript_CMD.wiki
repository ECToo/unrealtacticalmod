Is there a way to control my dedicated server when I am connected to it as a player?
- Yes. In order to do this you must have specified an Admin password in the command line that loads the dedicated server. 
{{{
To use, open a console (F10 or TAB) while in-game and use the following commands:

* AdminLogin <password> - logs you in as an admin
* AdminLogout <password> - logs you out of admin mode
* AdminRestartMap - restarts the current map
* AdminChangeMap <MapName> - loads a different map (gametype will change too, depending on map)
* Admin addbots <#> - adds # bots
* Admin killbots - removes all bots
* AdminPlayerList - shows PlayerID of players
* Adminkick <playername> - kicks player from current game
* Adminkickban <playername> - kicks player from current game and bans player from reconnecting (bans are stored in .ini file for later editing)
* AdminForceVoiceMute <playername> - blocks a player from sending voip to others
* AdminForceVoiceUnMute <playername> - allows a player to resume sending voip to others
* AdminForceTextMute <playername> - blocks a player from sending text to others
* AdminForceTextUnMute <playername> - allows a player to resume sending text to others
* AdminPublishMapList - overrides the server's map list for the current game type with the one on the client that used the command
* Admin DemoRec <name> - begin recording server-side demo of current map (demos are stored in \UTGame\Demos\)
