#summary Basc weapon modeling.
#labels Blender,Weapon,Model

= Plan Before Modeling =
Design your weapon and the basic layout in parts. Design each animation for what ever it an modling part or not. Each part must have some kind of bone to make it work to create your weapon actions.

We will be using shook rifle. That the most simple one.

When your building your Armature bones be sure you have one armature in your blender file. And fixed to your rotation by their default weapon.

There are two modeling that has to support two different animation in first person view and the third person view. They have be the same animation. But the bones are different from the 1P and 3P.

= Blender Modeling =

Make one model but in parts for making both 1P and 3P veiw. One for animation and other is for non moving parts animation but it will still have actions. Be Sure your face your model in the direction of the game default so look in the svn file to make sure it facing that way.

 * [Blender_Weapon_Model_1P]
 * [Blender_Weapon_Model_3P]

There are files in the svn are update for quick demo build and src code to test out the weapon test but there is no animation setup yet.

Here a quick demo for the weapon that I just made:
