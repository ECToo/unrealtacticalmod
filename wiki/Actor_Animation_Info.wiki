   This simple explain about how the animation work for class actor. It will required SkeletalMesh, AnimSets, and AnimTree.


=Unreal Script:=
   There are two method of using the animation codes. You can use the SkeletalMeshComponent or AnimNodeSequence. Those method works. Note if using the animation are not working, make sure it working.

  There are different of building your animation code. But learning the basic is the key on improve the code or using the the same code from unreal script prebuild codes. This is for noob to understand how works. But you need to learn how to model and animation them. That is the simple part of import and test out how it works.

= FAQS: =
 Q)  I create my own class base from Actor class and the animation not working. How Come?

 A)  You got to setup a link on your animtree and unreal script.

{{{
var AnimNodeSequence	AnimPlay;

simulated function PostBeginPlay()
{
	Super.PostBeginPlay();
	AnimPlay = AnimNodeSequence( Mesh.Animations.FindAnimNode('AnimPlayer') );//AnimTree
}
}}}
