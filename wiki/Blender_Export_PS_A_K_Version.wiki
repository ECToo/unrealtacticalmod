= Information =
I currently try to work as I make vehicles, weapons and other mods to make good game.

= Working Area =
 * Animation work needs to fix the off set.
 * Animation bones is build little differently and refine for new blender moder learn it.
 * Armature bone and Pose bone need to be solve that has it own independent rotation.
 * Every time I solve the code bug another one pop up so fixing take time to make it stable for a bit.

Animation Rotation Need Work on!

|| Armature Bone(PSK) || Pose Bone(PSA) || Export Script || Version ||
|| Bone=(0,0,0)  || Bone=(0,0,0)||  || 0.0.6 ||
||   || || Bone=(0,0,0) PSA || 0.0.6 ||
||   || || Bone=(0,0,0) PSK || 0.0.6 ||
|| Bone=(90,0,0) || Bone=(0,0,0) || || 0.0.6 ||
||   || || Bone=(0,0,0) PSA || 0.0.6 ||
||   || || Bone=(90,0,0) PSK || 0.0.6 ||
|| Bone=(90,0,0) ||Bone=(90,0,0)+ Bone=(0,0,0) || || 0.0.x || Work In Proggress!
||   || || Bone=(90,0,0) PSA || 0.0.6 ||
||   || || Bone=(90,0,0) PSK || 0.0.6 ||
Note that pose bone have one frame to test out the different when testing rotation.





== Errors ==
 * I know there are some error like offset bone are not fix yet and working out the main bone that crash when I try to work on it. It takes long hours to understand the code bit by bit until I can find a stable code output that will not crash me or other who wants to use free blender.
 * Just the main bone is difficult to fix a bit and trying to learn how are the export work in order of the bone and the parent index bone for unreal.


= Area Fix =
 * Main Bone Fixed
 * Animation Fix Rotation it was on the make_fquat() function rotate in other direction
 * Bone position set type is now this one ARMATURESPACE not BONESPACE It might change later.
 * Animation work needs to fix the off set in unreal.

= Solve =
 * Seem the animation weapon seem so what work and playable in the game. Just the rotation is bit off for some reason still looking into that later.
 * Main bones are issues to assign and fix the position when off grid to make weapon for first person view.
 * Bone position found error not off blender offset of the main. It only center the origin point need to be fix it.
