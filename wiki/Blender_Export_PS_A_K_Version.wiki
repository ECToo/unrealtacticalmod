= Information =
I currently try to work as I make vehicles, weapons and other mods to make good game. Plase not this information not be right learning takes time to fully uderstand what I doing.

= Working Area =
 * Animation work needs to fix the off set.
 * Animation bones is build little differently and refine for new blender moder learn it.
 * Every time I solve the code bug another one pop up so fixing take time to make it stable for a bit.

== Errors ==
 * I know there are some error like offset bone are not fix yet and working out the main bone that crash when I try to work on it. It takes long hours to understand the code bit by bit until I can find a stable code output that will not crash me or other who wants to use free blender.
 * Just the main bone is difficult to fix a bit and trying to learn how are the export work in order of the bone and the parent index bone for unreal.


= Area Fix =
 * Main Bone Fixed
 * Animation Fix Rotation it was on the make_fquat() function rotate in other direction
 * Bone position set type is now this one ARMATURESPACE not BONESPACE It might change later.
 * Animation work needs to fix the off set in unreal.


= Solve =
 * Armature bone and Pose bone need to be solve that has it own independent rotation.
 * Seem the animation weapon seem so what work and playable in the game. Just the rotation is bit off for some reason still looking into that later.
 * Main bones are issues to assign and fix the position when off grid to make weapon for first person view.
 * Bone position found error not off blender offset of the main. It only center the origin point need to be fix it.
 * Animation Rotation Need Work on! No Error Detect so far.
 * Note that pose bone have one frame to test out the different when testing rotation.
 * Main Bone Issues Need to be Fix First

Resaon the animation is not work well they off set bone are mess up just some of the area are working. Looking at the old file seem to work. This will be the top on the list to fix some area. Until the main are fix the animation will work in all the area. Finding a way to make the main bone to be stable when exported.
