= Information =
I currently try to work as I make vehicles, weapons and other mods to make good mod games.

Every time I solve the code bug another one pop up so fixing take time to make it stable for a bit.

== Version ==
Current Version of the export is 0.0.4.

== Erorr ==
I know there are some error like offset bone are not fix yet and working out the main bone that crash when I try to work on it. It takes a long hours to understand the code bit by bit until I can find a stable code output that will not crash me or other who want to use free blender.
