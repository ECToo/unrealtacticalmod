#summary Current Version 0.0.5

= Information =
I currently try to work as I make vehicles, weapons and other mods to make good game.

= Working Area =
 * Animation work needs to fix the off set.
 * Every time I solve the code bug another one pop up so fixing take time to make it stable for a bit.

== Errors ==
 * Main bones are issues to assign and fix the position when off grid to make weapon for first person view.
 * Bone position found error not off blender offset of the main. It only center the origin point need to be fix it.
 * I know there are some error like offset bone are not fix yet and working out the main bone that crash when I try to work on it. It takes long hours to understand the code bit by bit until I can find a stable code output that will not crash me or other who wants to use free blender.
 * Just the main bone is difficult to fix a bit and trying to learn how are the export work in order of the bone and the parent index bone for unreal.
