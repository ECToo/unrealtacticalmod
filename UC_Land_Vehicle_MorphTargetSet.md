This part where your vehicle is damage. This is a simple import your mesh in the MorphTargetSet.

## Software Exporting ##
For any software that you exporting to is that you have to make the file psk. The model vehicle damage should have some deform for where area might be damage. Make each part damage like your doors, fenders, wings, etc to make look it really damages vehicles. Export each of the file name and keep the bones ratio to the same when the vehicle is moving it should act as the same one but in damage form.

## Create MorphTargetSet ##
Create your MorphTargetSet that is current mesh object your making. Name your package careful of the UT3 Default build to make your self better builder of your vehicle mod.

You have to export your mesh in psk format keep your vehicle the same as possible to keep your files from getting big. Build your vehicle into pieces of the places are damage.
While your in your MorphTargetSet go to:
### Importing Your Psk Mesh in MorphTargetSet ###
File > Import MorphTarget > YourPSK.File

You be ask to name your damage part of your to keep the UT3 format clean.

If you are getting error like the object stay the same update your weights that depend if you using the same model. Well Doing a quick test it works. I not sure about the textures yet.
